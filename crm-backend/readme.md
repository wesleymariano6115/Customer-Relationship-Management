## Authentication & Middleware

- **authMiddleware.js**: Protects routes using JWT-based authentication.
- **validateUser.js**: Validates user input for registration and login.
- **errorMiddleware.js**: Centralized error handling for API responses.

Role-based access ensures only authorized users can access sensitive endpoints.

---

## Models / Entities

- **User**: System users (admin, sales rep) with roles and credentials.
- **Customer**: Customer profiles and contact information.
- **Lead**: Potential customers and their status.
- **Sales**: Sales records and transactions.
- **Activity**: Logs of user and sales activities.
- **Notification**: System notifications for users.

---

## Utilities

- **generateToken.js**: Creates JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.
- **reportGenerator.js**: Generates sales and activity reports (PDF/CSV).
